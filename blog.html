                            4. Lamu Island – A Step Back in Time
                            Lamu is a coastal treasure, known for its well-preserved Swahili culture and ancient architecture. Although it has gained some popularity in recent years, it still retains an aura of peace and tranquility.

                            Introduction

                            The Great Migration is not just a spectacle for tourists—it’s also a vital part of the ecosystem. The animals’ movement helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem by preventing overgrazing in one area, which supports the health of the grasslands. Additionally, many conservation organizations are working to ensure that the migration continues unhindered by human development.
